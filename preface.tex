I would like to sincerely thank my academic supervisor, Dr. Ir. Luc De Raedt and my daily supervisor, Dr. Ir. Robin Manhaeve, for all their patient help and insightful input in the process of creating this work. \par
I would also like to thank my family in general and my partner in particular. This thesis was written under personally challenging circumstances and I genuinely could not have completed it without their day to day support and encouragement.
